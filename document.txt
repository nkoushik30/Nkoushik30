Title: GitHub Collaboration Using Branching and Pull Requests
Task:
You are required to perform a Git-based collaboration activity using GitHub by working in a team of two students. One student will act as the repository owner and the other as a collaborator.
Problem Statement
Create and collaboratively maintain a GitHub repository named
Git-Collaboration-Lab-<TeamNo>
to demonstrate real-time collaboration using Git commands, branching, pull requests, reviews, and merge conflict resolution.

Instructions
1.	The repository owner shall create the GitHub repository and add the second student as a collaborator.
2.	Both students shall clone the repository to their local system.
3.	The collaborator shall create a new branch and make changes to the README.md file by adding their details.
4.	The collaborator shall commit the changes and raise a Pull Request to the main branch.
5.	The repository owner shall review the Pull Request, add at least one comment, and merge it.
6.	Both students shall intentionally modify the same section of a file (TASKS.md) to create a merge conflict.
7.	The collaborator shall resolve the conflict and update the Pull Request.
8.	The final merged version shall be pushed to the main branch.
